##AutoSpeed

Program for learning mini cars driving on race track. The cars used neural nets which are optimized with NEAT algorithm. Program consists of fully customized learning environment (NEAT parameters, track selection, cars sensor customization, inital genome settings etc.) and track editor. (PROJECT NOT FINISHED)
